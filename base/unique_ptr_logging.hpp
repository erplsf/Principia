// here too.

// Note that if you want to use these operators from the non-global namespace,
// you may get an error since they are not in namespace std (and they are not
// in namespace std since that would result in undefined behavior).  You may
// need to write
//
//   using ::operator<<;
//
// to fix these errors.

// Logs the pointer.  No transfer of ownership.
